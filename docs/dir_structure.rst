Directory Structure
===================

I will not fully describe all funcitions of all directories and files. This should be left to module explanation docs or README file under each directory. Here I will just briefly introduce you to some of the folders and files.

* *docs*. Directory storing files asscioated with (this) documentations. 
.. * *Malmo-0.34.0-Linux-Ubuntu-16.04-64bit_withBoost_Python2.7*. This is the directory of Malmo platform.
* *Research*. Directory for storing researching codes.

Under the folder *Research*, there are 3 folders:

* *imitate_experiments*. My currently working directory. All experiments involving imitation module are performed in here. All experiments will be recorded in 3 digits code, such as 001, and stored in a folder in the same name.
* *explore_experiments*. My second currently working directory. Experiments relating exploring module happens here.
.. * *pygame*. The pygame package clone.
* *third_person_im*. A fork of RLLab project, a clone of the third-person imitation learning project by Bradly Stadie, Pieter Abbeel adn Ilya Sutskever. For third-person imitation project, check this `link <http://github.com/bstadie/third_person_im>`_. For RLLab project (which is also under Prof. Abbeel's name), check `this <https://github.com/rll/rllab>`_. The first project is research oriented, so it is no longer supported. The latter project hasn't been updated for over 6 months, so it's pretty rusty and can only be used as reference.
